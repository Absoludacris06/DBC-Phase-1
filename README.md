DBC Phase 1 Portfolio Work
==========================

This repo contains examples of work done during the first 3 weeks of DBC.  Most of the challenges during that time focused on diving deeper into basic Ruby and learning the basics of OOP, version control (via Git & GitHub), refactoring, SQL databases, ActiveRecord, and scraping & parsing.  I'm proud of this work, but I'll also be the first to admit it could use a little touching up.
